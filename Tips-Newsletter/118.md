**Browsing metatdata from SAS**

From SAS 9 you can browse through metadata via the Explorer Pane (if you
have metadata via a metadata sever defined). To enable this follow these
steps:

> 1\. Start SAS 9
>
> 2\. Click on the Explorer pane to activate it or use the menu
> VIEW/CONTENTS ONLY.
>
> 3\. Now select TOOLS/OPTIONS/EXPLORER
>
> 4\. Under the GENERAL tab select the METADATA SERVERS check box, and
> then click on OK.
>
> 5\. There will now be a new METADATA SERVERS icon in the Explorer
> pane. Click on this to show its contents. There will be nothing there
> yet.
>
> 6\. Right click in the explorer pane and select NEW. This allows you
> to define a connection to a metadata server -- which may be on your
> machine, or elsewhere. Define this and any others you may want.
>
> 7\. Now you can continue to drill down through the metadata to examine
> it.

p.s. thanks to my friend Chris Brooks (National Statistics, UK) for
discovering this one.

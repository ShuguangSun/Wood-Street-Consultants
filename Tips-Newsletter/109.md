**Building a library of useful macros**

As a SAS programmer it is useful to have a collection of frequently used
SAS macros. Some of these are so general purpose that they can be used
by many different SAS programmers in different companies, whereas others
will be quite specific to where you may be working now. Here is a list
of some that I have written for use in work I have done recently. You
can find them at [http://www.woodstreet.org.uk/Macros]{.underline} and
you are free to download and use them if you wish.

> • Fmt - create a format based on a dataset
>
> • Chmod -- change permissions for UNIX files/directories when creating
> a new dataset
>
> • Doc -- strips out comments from SAS programs to create documentation
> -- useful if you follow some coding guidelines
>
> • Catscan -- copies all text from a SAS catalog to an external file
> and then views it, so you can search for text
>
> • Cliplog2dset -- copies a section of SAS log and stores it in a
> dataset
>
> • Copyfile -- copies a SAS dataset from one place to another using
> operating system commands (which are usually more efficient)
>
> • Vars_on_dset -- returns a list of variables that exist on a dataset
> from a specified list -- useful when you need to code a list of
> variables but sometimes they may not all be possible
>
> • From & till -- use to mark the start and end of a section of code --
> comment block is written indicating timings
>
> • Start & finish -- use to mark the start and end of a section of
> macro code so that the code generated by macros is written to an
> external file thus making debugging easier
>
> • Label -- returns the label of a variable, which could then be used
> in a title/footnote
>
> • Progress & progress2 -- implements a progress bar in a data step

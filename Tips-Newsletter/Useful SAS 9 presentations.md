**Useful SAS 9 presentations**

If you want to quickly put together a SAS 9 presentation for people at
work, then you can often find very useful presentations on the net --
but it can be hard to find them. I recently found one site that had
several extremely useful ones. It is the SAS ACT Users Group (Australia)
found at [http://sausag.sasusers.net/presentations.htm]{.underline} and
also has a short tips page at
[http://sausag.sasusers.net/tips.htm]{.underline}.

> My favourite paper from this site is a SAS 9 overview by Neil Doody
> (SAS Institute), who happens to be an old friend of mine. It's called
> "[Under the Covers of SAS 9.1]{.underline}" and is a great overview of
> SAS 9 architecture and the various products within it.

Here are some of the other good ones there...
